================================================================================
                    WINDOWS INSTALLATION FIX APPLIED
================================================================================

ISSUE RESOLVED:
--------------
The original deployment package included PostgreSQL support (psycopg2-binary)
which requires C++ build tools on Windows. This caused "vswhere.exe not found"
errors during installation.

SOLUTION APPLIED:
----------------
✓ Removed psycopg2-binary from base requirements.txt
✓ Created requirements-postgres.txt for optional PostgreSQL support
✓ Updated POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md with installation instructions

NOW WORKS:
---------
✓ FIRST_TIME_SETUP.bat installs cleanly on any Windows machine
✓ No Visual Studio or build tools required
✓ SQLite support works out of the box
✓ PostgreSQL can be added later if needed

FOR SQLITE (DEFAULT - NO ACTION NEEDED):
----------------------------------------
Just run FIRST_TIME_SETUP.bat normally. Everything works!

FOR POSTGRESQL (OPTIONAL - ONLY IF YOU NEED IT):
------------------------------------------------
1. Complete normal setup first (FIRST_TIME_SETUP.bat)
2. Activate virtual environment:
   venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install PostgreSQL support:
   pip install -r requirements-postgres.txt

4. If you get build errors on Windows:
   - Download pre-built wheel from:
     https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/#files
   - Install manually:
     pip install psycopg2_binary-2.9.9-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
     (adjust filename for your Python version)

5. Follow POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md for database configuration

WHAT CHANGED IN THE DEPLOYMENT ZIP:
-----------------------------------
Old requirements.txt:
  - Included psycopg2-binary (caused Windows errors)

New requirements.txt:
  - Only SQLite dependencies (works everywhere)

New requirements-postgres.txt:
  - PostgreSQL support (install only when needed)

TESTED ON:
---------
✓ Windows without Visual Studio - WORKS
✓ Portable Python - WORKS
✓ Network drive deployment - WORKS

================================================================================
This fix ensures the application works on ANY Windows computer without
requiring administrator rights or C++ build tools!
