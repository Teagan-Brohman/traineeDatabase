                    TRAINEE BADGE TRACKER - HOW TO USE
                          Network Drive Version
================================================================================

This application tracks trainee progress through training requirements.
It runs on ONE computer and everyone accesses it through their web browser.

================================================================================
                           FIRST TIME SETUP
================================================================================

!! ONLY ONE PERSON NEEDS TO DO THIS - USUALLY THE ADMINISTRATOR !!

OPTION A - Standard Python Installation (Recommended):
------------------------------------------------------
1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer
   - If not installed, download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - During installation, CHECK the box "Add Python to PATH"
   - Any Python version 3.8 or higher works

2. Double-click: FIRST_TIME_SETUP.bat
   - Follow the prompts
   - Create an admin username and password (WRITE IT DOWN!)
   - Wait for "SETUP COMPLETE!" message

3. Done! Setup is complete.


OPTION B - Portable Python (For Network Drive without Installation):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a PORTABLE Python installation that's not in your system PATH:

1. Open PYTHON_PATH.txt in Notepad

2. Find the line that says:
   REM SET PYTHON_PATH=C:\Path\To\Your\python.exe

3. Remove "REM" and change the path to YOUR Python location:
   SET PYTHON_PATH=C:\PortablePython\python.exe

   Examples:
   - Local portable: SET PYTHON_PATH=C:\PortablePython\python.exe
   - Network drive:  SET PYTHON_PATH=Z:\Tools\Python\python.exe
   - USB drive:      SET PYTHON_PATH=E:\Python39\python.exe

4. Save and close PYTHON_PATH.txt

5. Double-click: FIRST_TIME_SETUP.bat
   - It will now use your portable Python
   - Follow the prompts
   - Create an admin username and password (WRITE IT DOWN!)
   - Wait for "SETUP COMPLETE!" message

6. Done! Setup is complete.

                            TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: "Python is not installed" or "Python is not found"
SOLUTION:
  Option 1: Install Python from python.org
            During install, check "Add Python to PATH"

  Option 2: If you have portable Python, configure PYTHON_PATH.txt
            1. Open PYTHON_PATH.txt in Notepad
            2. Remove "REM" from the PYTHON_PATH line
            3. Set the full path to your python.exe
               Example: SET PYTHON_PATH=C:\PortablePython\python.exe
            4. Save and try again

PROBLEM: Can't access from other computers
SOLUTION:
  - Make sure START_SERVER.bat is running
  - Check Windows Firewall (may need to allow Python)
  - Use the correct IP address (shown when server starts)
  - Try: http://COMPUTERNAME:8000 instead of IP address

PROBLEM: Database is locked
SOLUTION: Only one person should run START_SERVER.bat at a time
          If someone else is running it, close their server first

PROBLEM: Changes aren't showing up
SOLUTION: Refresh the browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)

PROBLEM: Forgot admin password
SOLUTION:
  1. Open Command Prompt in application folder
  2. Type: venv\Scripts\activate
  3. Type: python manage.py createsuperuser
  4. Create a new admin account

                              IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

1. BACKUP: The database file (db.sqlite3) contains all your data
   - Copy it regularly to another location
   - Store backups securely

2. NETWORK DRIVE: This application is designed to run from a shared drive
   - Only ONE person runs the server
   - Everyone else accesses via browser
   - Don't run multiple servers on the same database!

3. SECURITY:
   - Change DEBUG=False in .env for production use
   - Use strong passwords for admin accounts
   - Don't share admin credentials

4. UPDATES:
   - If you update the code, run FIRST_TIME_SETUP.bat again
   - This ensures database migrations are applied
